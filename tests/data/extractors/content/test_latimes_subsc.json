        "cleaned_text": "A Russian passenger jet crashed shortly after taking off from one of Moscow's major airports Sunday, killing all 71 people aboard. The plane, an Antonov An-148 passenger airliner operated by Saratov Airlines, was carrying 65 passengers and six crew members when it left Moscow's Domodedovo airport for Orsk, a city about 1,000 miles southeast of the capital near the Kazakhstan border. Investigators said the plane took off at 2:21 p.m. and reached an altitude of 6,400 feet before disappearing from radar screens about four minutes after takeoff, the Tass Russian news agency reported, citing the Moscow interregional transport prosecutor's office. The wreckage of the aircraft was found about 25 miles south of the airport in the Ramenskoye district. Television reports showed investigators searching in a snow-covered field. The images showed pieces of the wreckage spread out across what investigators said was about a half-mile radius. One flight recorder was found, Tass reported, but the news agency did not specify whether it was a voice or data recorder. Russian investigators said they were not ruling out weather conditions, a crew error or a technical malfunction as a possible cause of the crash."

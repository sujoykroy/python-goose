        "cleaned_text": "The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on Tuesday ruled that the detention of a Turkish Constitutional Court judge following the country’s 2016 coup attempt was unlawful.\n\nAlparslan Altan was detained on July 16, 2016, a day after the failed putsch, and was arrested by an Ankara court four days later. The judge remained in pre-trial detention until January 2018, when he was indicted. A prosecutor demanded an 11 year and three month prison sentence for Altan over links to the Gülen movement, which Ankara designates a terrorist organisation and accuses of orchestrating the failed coup attempt."

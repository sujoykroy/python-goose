        "cleaned_text": "The New Zealand dollar has continued to fall trading at an almost three-year low against the US dollar on Monday - and while motorists are already feeling the effects, it's good news for some.\n\n\n\nA weaker dollar means higher costs for imports like petrol, and that's often passed onto the consumer, ANZ Chief economist Sharon Zollner says.\n\n\"It will gradually feed through to everything we buy - from cars to computers, to the food we import as well.\""

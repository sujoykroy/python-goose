        "cleaned_text": "Anheuser-Busch is synonymous with St. Louis, but what’s not as well-known is that the beer company has long had a big operation in Jacksonville, quenching Florida’s thirst.\n\nSince 1974, the king of beers has produced aluminum beer cans there, cranking out up to 2,500 a minute — a thriving operation that it says is threatened by President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.\n\nA year ago, Anheuser-Busch opened a metal container plant that makes aluminum bottles, adding 75 jobs with the help of state incentives from Gov. Rick Scott, who clutched scissors at a ribbon-cutting in May of last year and was on hand for a ground-breaking ceremony in 2015.\n\nEveryone was all smiles.\n\nThen came the tariffs. Trump on June 1 imposed a 25 percent steel tariff and 10 percent aluminum tariff on Mexico and Canada as a way to reshape the North American Free Trade Agreement. Other tariffs were slapped on the European Union and other countries."

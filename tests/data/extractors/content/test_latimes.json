        "cleaned_text": "Three Democratic candidates for governor have millions of dollars to spend in the closing days of the California primary, according to campaign finance reports filed with the secretary of state’s office. Their rivals are badly lagging, though the top Republican candidate in the race has the ability to pour more of his personal wealth into his campaign.\n\nThe reports, filed Thursday with the state, insure that Californians will continue to see a barrage of advertisements and mailers up until the June 5 primary.\n\nLt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the long-time polling and fundraising front-runner, once again leads the pack with nearly $9.8 million cash on hand. That’s roughly the amount he spent between April 22 and May 19, the period covered by the fundraising reports. About 85% was spent on television ads.\n\nNewsom also raised more than $1.5 million during that period, with major donations from labor unions, as well as wine industry interests and a law enforcement political action committee. Notable individual contributors included Los Angeles Chargers owner Alex Spanos, a major GOP donor, and HBO’s “Real Time” host, Bill Maher.\n\nNewsom also has $2.9 million parked in his 2014 lieutenant governor’s campaign account.\n\nFormer Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa reported having $2.3 million cash on hand, having spent $5.8 million in the month-long reporting period. He also allocated the vast majority of the nearly $5.5 million he spent on television ads. The remainder went to polling, political consultants, fundraising and other campaign expenses.\n\nCalifornia agricultural organizations were among some of the biggest donors during the reporting period. Blue Diamond Growers, which represents two-thirds of California's almond growers, contributed $40,000 to Villaraigosa’s campaign. California Citrus Mutual donated $24,000 and the California Rice political action committee wrote a check for $20,000.\n\nBoth Newsom and Villaraigosa have multiple independent expenditure committees with large reserves of cash supporting them — $2.4 million for pro-Newsom efforts and $1.8 million for pro-Villaraigosa efforts.\n\nVillaraigosa is in a tight contest with Republican businessman John Cox for second place in the June primary. He reported spending $1.7 million during the reporting period, fairly evenly divided between television and radio advertising, telephone banks and campaign mailers.\n\nCox raised $506,410, including $50,000 from Cox’s personal bank account, plus $100,000 he loaned to his campaign. That comes on top of the more than $4 million he’s already donated to his campaign.\n\nHe ended the fundraising period with $124,000 cash in his campaign account, but political observers question whether he will invest more of his wealth in the race, particularly to tout the Friday endorsement by President Trump\n\nOf the three candidates in the single digits in the polls, only one has notable resources. State Treasurer John Chiang has nearly $4.4 million cash on hand to spend between now and June 5. He reported spending $4.1 million in the most recent reporting period, while he raised nearly $614,000.\n\nFellow Democrat Delaine Eastin reported having $127,000 cash on hand, and spending almost the same amount during the reporting period."
